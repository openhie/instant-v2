# Vision

The Instant OpenHIE project aims to **reduce the costs and skills** required for software developers to deploy applications conforming to an OpenHIE architecture. This will enable quicker initial solution testing, demonstrations. It will also serve as a starting point for faster production implementation and customisation.

Instant OpenHIE is a simple way for semi-technical persons to install and see a complex system working against a real-world use case. It will illustrate how interoperability can work to solve health challenges. It will also show how a national interoperability architecture could be created with open-source software and standards.

Instant OpenHIE aim to provide a simple, portable way to deploy health information exchange systems to facilitate:

1. **Demonstrable reference products** - those that align with the OpenHIE Community's vision for low resource contexts
2. **Rapid software development** of mediators and point-of-service systems by making it possible to launch several applications easily so the developer can focus on their task
3. **Reproducible, version-controlled infrastructure** for user-contributed tests of the OpenHIE Architecture profiles, workflows, and use cases.
4. **Production-ready** containers and orchestratable components that are deployable in any context.
5. **Extensibility** so that anyone may create Instant OpenHIE packages and plug them into the existing Instant OpenHIE functionality.
